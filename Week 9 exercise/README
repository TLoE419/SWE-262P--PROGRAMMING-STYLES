Week 9 Exercise - Style #28: Lazy Rivers
==========================================

This week implements the term frequency program using lazy evaluation patterns.
Two implementations are provided:

1. Iterators.java - Custom Iterator classes that mimic Python generators
2. Streams.java - Java Stream API for functional lazy evaluation

APPROACH 1: Custom Iterators
-----------------------------

Compilation and Execution:

  javac Iterators.java
  java Iterators ../pride-and-prejudice.txt


APPROACH 2: Java Stream API
----------------------------

Compilation and Execution:

  javac Streams.java
  java Streams ../pride-and-prejudice.txt

TESTING
-------

You can test with different input files:

  java Iterators ../pride-and-prejudice.txt
  java Streams ../pride-and-prejudice.txt

Both should produce identical results (order may vary for words with
same frequency).
