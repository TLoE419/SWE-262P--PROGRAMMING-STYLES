Week 8 Exercise - Style #20: Plugins
======================================

Word Extractors:
1. extractor_word_1 - Extracts all non-stop words (normal extraction)
2. extractor_word_2 - Extracts only non-stop words containing the letter 'z'

Word Counters:
1. counter_word_1 - Counts word frequencies and returns top 25 (normal counting)
2. counter_word_2 - Counts words by their first letter (a, b, c, etc.)

From the Week8 directory, run:

  javac Twenty.java
  javac plugins/*.java

  java Twenty <path_to_text_file>

Example:
  java Twenty ../pride-and-prejudice.txt

Edit config.properties to select different plugin combinations:

  extractor=plugins.extractor_word_1   (or plugins.extractor_word_2)
  counter=plugins.counter_word_1       (or plugins.counter_word_2)

You can test all 4 combinations:
1. extractor_word_1 + counter_word_1 (normal extraction + word frequency)
2. extractor_word_1 + counter_word_2 (normal extraction + first letter count)
3. extractor_word_2 + counter_word_1 (words with z + word frequency)
4. extractor_word_2 + counter_word_2 (words with z + first letter count)
